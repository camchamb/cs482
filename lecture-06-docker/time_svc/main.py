"""Minimal internal FastAPI service that returns the current UTC time.

This service is a stand-in for the kind of sidecar you'd add for real work:
a database, a cache, a background worker, a local ML model server. The point
is to show the multi-service pattern — `hello` (the public API) reaches this
service by its Compose service name (`time`) over the internal Docker
network. Only `hello` is Traefik-routed; this service is internal-only.
